## Tarot - The Keyword Based Color Palette Generator

Generate conceptual color palettes for any project where you might want a color scheme!
Renovating the bathroom with a coastal theme? Try "mediterranean" or "big sur".
Building a Star Wars fan site? Try "mandalorian".
The results can be surprisingly accurate or hilariously off the wall.

### Libraries and Technologies 

This project was built entirely with React and uses Firebase for user auth and firestore (saving of palettes).

Currently state management is handled solely with component based state, mostly functional hooks and one quite large class component in the "Tarot" page component. This was intended as an exercise to see just how convoluted sticking to component based state management can become, and to help myself learn redux in the process of converting it over. I intend to develop my own "best practices" of what state management to use when and where by going through the "Tarot" component and converting it over Redux / Hooks / Context where applicable.
